TODO REFACTORING:

- Encapsulate the behaviour in the getDateSensitiveData() function in pages/api/getDeveloperData.ts and restructure how getEventsData() calls it, so in the future it's possible to
call it with however many time spans we want without having to create a bunch of new variables, parameters and checks for each time span.
